# Research Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Strategy**: A research-concurrent approach will be adopted. Research will be conducted for each chapter as it is being written, rather than all upfront. This ensures the information is current and relevant to the specific topic being discussed.

**Primary Sources**:
-   Peer-reviewed academic papers from sources like IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and arXiv.
-   Official documentation for ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.
-   Publications from leading robotics research labs (e.g., MIT, Stanford, CMU).
-   Technical blogs and articles from reputable industry sources (e.g., Boston Dynamics, NVIDIA).

**Citation Management**:
-   All sources will be tracked using a citation manager (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley).
-   Citations will be formatted in APA 7th edition, as per the project constitution.

**Validation**:
-   All technical claims and statistics will be cross-referenced with at least two reliable sources where possible.
-   A final accuracy review will be conducted on the completed manuscript.

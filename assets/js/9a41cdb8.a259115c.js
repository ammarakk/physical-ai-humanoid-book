Unlike traditional AI, which often focuses on abstract reasoning and symbolic manipulation, Embodied AI posits that many aspects of cognition, such as perception, learning, and decision-making, are shaped by the sensorimotor experiences of an agent. This field draws heavily from robotics, cognitive science, and neuroscience, seeking to understand how physical embodiment contributes to intelligent behavior. It challenges the notion that intelligence can exist purely as a disembodied computational process, arguing instead that the body provides a fundamental scaffold for cognitive development and adaptive behavior. The study of embodied intelligence is crucial for the advancement of humanoid robotics, as it informs the design of agents capable of robust and flexible interaction within complex physical worlds."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Historical Context and Evolution"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The concept of embodied intelligence has roots in early cybernetics and situated cognition, emerging as a significant paradigm shift from the purely symbolic AI approaches of the 20th century. Pioneers like Rodney Brooks advocated for "Nouvelle AI," which emphasized building intelligence from the bottom up, through direct interaction with the environment rather than reliance on complex internal models. This approach highlighted the importance of real-time sensorimotor coupling and the idea that "the world is its own best model" [CITATION: Brooks, 1990]. Over the decades, advancements in robotics, sensor technology, and computational power have allowed researchers to build more sophisticated embodied agents, moving from simple reactive behaviors to more complex, adaptive, and learning systems. The evolution of this field has been marked by a growing recognition of the role of morphology, material properties, and physical constraints in shaping intelligent behavior.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Key Concepts and Principles"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Several core concepts underpin embodied intelligence:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.li,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Sensorimotor Contingency:"})," The idea that perception is not a passive reception of data but an active exploration and manipulation of the environment through sensory and motor interactions.
